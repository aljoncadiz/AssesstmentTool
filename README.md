When adding files: 
1. First add the file to your local repository by:     git add "filename.cs"
2. Commit the changes to your local repository by:    git commit -m "Any comments needed"
3. Push the changes to the remote repository by:    git push origin master

When updating files, for example "filename.cs"
1. Add the untracked changes by:  git add "filename.cs"
2. Commit the changes to local repo by:   git commit -m "Any comments needed"
3. Push the changes to the remote repository by:   git push origin master

Getting/pulling changes from remote to your local repo:
1. git pull origin - this fetches the data from the server and will try to merge it into the code currently worked on.
